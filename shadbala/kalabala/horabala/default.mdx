# Horabala - Hour Strength

Horabala is a component of Kalabala that calculates planetary strength based on the hour of birth.

## Concept

Each day is divided into 24 hours, and each hour is ruled by a specific planet following a particular sequence. The strength of a planet increases when the birth occurs during its ruling hour.

## Planetary Hour Sequence

The sequence of planetary hours follows the order:

1. Sun (first hour of Sunday)
2. Venus
3. Mercury
4. Moon
5. Saturn
6. Jupiter
7. Mars

This sequence repeats throughout the day and night, with each planet ruling approximately one hour.

## Calculation Method

Horabala is calculated by:

1. Determining which planet rules the hour of birth
2. Assigning strength points based on the relationship between the ruling planet and the planet being evaluated
3. Considering the day of the week and its ruling planet

## Strength Points

- Maximum strength when the planet rules the hour
- Moderate strength when the hour ruler is friendly
- Reduced strength when the hour ruler is neutral or inimical

## Significance

Horabala contributes to the overall Kalabala and helps determine:

- The immediate effectiveness of planets at birth
- The quality of the first dasha period
- The initial strength of planetary influences

## Example

If someone is born during the hour ruled by Jupiter, then Jupiter receives maximum Horabala, making it particularly strong at the time of birth.
