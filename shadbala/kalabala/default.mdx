# Kalabala - Temporal Strength

Kalabala refers to the temporal or time-based strength of planets. It considers various time-related factors that influence planetary strength.

## Components of Kalabala

Kalabala is calculated based on several time factors:

### 1. Nathonabala (Day/Night Strength)
- Planets have different strengths during day and night
- Sun, Mars, and Jupiter are stronger during the day
- Moon, Venus, and Saturn are stronger during the night
- Mercury is neutral

### 2. Pakshabala (Lunar Phase Strength)
- Strength based on the phase of the Moon
- Waxing Moon (Shukla Paksha) favors certain planets
- Waning Moon (Krishna Paksha) favors others

### 3. Tribhagabala (Three-Part Strength)
- Strength based on the division of day/night into three parts
- Each part has different planetary rulerships

### 4. Varshabala (Year Strength)
- Strength based on the year of birth
- Different years favor different planets

### 5. Masabala (Month Strength)
- Strength based on the month of birth
- Each month has specific planetary influences

### 6. Dinabala (Day Strength)
- Strength based on the day of the week
- Each weekday is ruled by a specific planet

## Calculation

Kalabala is calculated by combining all these temporal factors. The total Kalabala contributes significantly to the overall Shadbala of a planet.

## Significance

A planet with high Kalabala:

- Is more effective during its dasha periods
- Can overcome other weaknesses to some extent
- Shows better timing for events related to its significations

## Practical Application

When analyzing a chart, Kalabala helps determine:

- The best timing for important activities
- The strength of planetary periods
- The effectiveness of remedies and upayas
