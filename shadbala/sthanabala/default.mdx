# Sthanabala - Positional Strength

Sthanabala refers to the strength a planet gains based on its position in the birth chart. It is one of the six components of Shadbala.

## Components of Sthanabala

Sthanabala is calculated from several positional factors:

### 1. Uchchabala (Exaltation Strength)
- Maximum strength when planet is in its exaltation sign
- Reduced strength in other signs
- Debilitation gives negative strength

### 2. Saptavargajabala (Seven-Fold Strength)
- Strength from placement in different vargas (divisional charts)
- Considers D1, D2, D3, D7, D9, D10, D12 charts
- Each varga placement adds to total strength

### 3. Ojayugmarashyamsabala
- Strength based on odd/even signs
- Some planets are stronger in odd signs (Aries, Gemini, etc.)
- Others are stronger in even signs (Taurus, Cancer, etc.)

### 4. Kendradibala (Angular Strength)
- Planets in angular houses (1st, 4th, 7th, 10th) gain strength
- Trinal houses (1st, 5th, 9th) also provide strength
- Different planets have different preferred house types

### 5. Drekkonabala (Triangular Strength)
- Strength from placement in specific triads
- Considers the relationship between signs and houses

## Calculation

Sthanabala combines all these positional factors to give a total score. This score indicates how strong a planet is based purely on its placement in the chart.

## Significance

A planet with high Sthanabala:

- Is well-placed and can express its nature effectively
- Can give favorable results even if other strengths are moderate
- Shows the planet is in a supportive environment

## Practical Application

When analyzing a chart:

- High Sthanabala indicates good placement
- Low Sthanabala may require remedies
- Combined with other strengths, it shows overall planetary effectiveness
